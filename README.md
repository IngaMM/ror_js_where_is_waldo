I used Ruby on Rails, Javascript, HTML, CSS.

This is a fun game written in Ruby on Rails combined with some Javascript. At the beginning of the game the player has the choice between two collections of similar faces. Then he/she has to find the faces of the small pictures inside the big one as quickly as possible. For each choice the player gets feedback on whether he/she is correct or not. The best results are stored in a high-score list. The app is fully responsive and can be viewed on screens of all sizes.

A live version of this app can be found at http://face-search22.herokuapp.com/
