By I. Mahle

A project of The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app

Discussion
I used Ruby on Rails (backend), HTML, CSS, Javascript (frontend).

At the beginning of the game the player has the choice between two large pictures with collections of similar faces. He/she has to find the faces in the small pictures inside the big one. For each selection the player will get a feedback on whether he/she is correct or not. The best results are stored in a high-score list.
